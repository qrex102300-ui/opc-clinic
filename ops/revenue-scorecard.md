# OPC Clinic Revenue Sprint — Auditable Scorecard

Last checked: **2026-09-10 15:00 CST**  
Experiment window: **2026-09-09 → 2026-09-15**

This is the canonical operational count for the 7-day revenue sprint. Counts move only on observable evidence. A directory submission is not a lead; a lead is not revenue; only confirmed collected payment counts as revenue.

| Metric | Current | Evidence rule |
|---|---:|---|
| Confirmed external listings / referral surfaces | **6** | Public listing or directory/API evidence confirms OPC Clinic is live |
| Pending external directory / registry reviews | **6** | Submission accepted but not yet confirmed as a default public listing |
| Inbound free-triage submissions | **0** | A real external user opens a `[Free Triage]` case |
| Qualified leads | **0** | Launched/tested product + real evidence + near-term decision; case fits deeper diagnosis |
| Payment-ready leads | **0** | Qualified case is ready for the $59 offer and only payment/custody remains |
| Paid orders | **0** | Sufficient customer context plus a valid payment transaction |
| Gross revenue | **$0** | Confirmed collected payment only |
| Refunds | **$0** | Confirmed refunded amount |
| Payment fees | **$0** | Confirmed fees attributable to collected sprint revenue |
| Net revenue | **$0** | Gross revenue − refunds − payment fees |
| Paid acquisition spend | **$0** | Actual paid distribution, ads, or tools used for this sprint |

## Latest acquisition checkpoint

The 15:00 CST run remained acquisition-first and made no landing-page, product, pricing, copy, or SEO changes. It screened additional current discovery routes and rejected those requiring submitter/business email, sign-in, private agent credentials, reciprocal backlinks, or a poor fit with the directory's stated rules. The already-counted PromptFrenzy listing remains publicly discoverable; no pending review was promoted to confirmed in this run.

## Operating rule

Acquisition remains the bottleneck. Do not spend sprint cycles polishing the landing page, copy, pricing, or SEO without new observed user behavior identifying a specific funnel defect. Prioritize legitimate zero-cost distribution and high-fit public demand surfaces. Never post unsolicited promotional comments into unrelated communities or issues, never spend money, and never use private credentials or owner identity to force a listing.
